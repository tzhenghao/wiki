#A Short Introduction to Vim

For those of you who use Emacs or Sublime, you are welcome to read on :D

##So what is Vim?

Vim is a text-editor that allows you to type out just about anything. It's
more powerful than Notepad, but generally have a much steeper learning curve
so you can operate at full speed. It's all about muscle memory, and I'm here to
help you out. :)

##Skipping the history lessons. I will let Wikipedia do it for me.

There are 3 main modes in Vim:

1. Normal mode

2. Insert mode

3. Visual mode

##Normal Mode
This is the 'normal' mode where you will typically see or start out with


##Insert Mode



##Visual Mode



##The .vimrc
This is the magical place where most of your Vim customizations live. Everything
from key mappings to keyboard shortcuts are typically done here. Vim will load all
your settings from a .vimrc file that lives in your home folder (default) if it finds one.

##Color schemes
Don't like the white (default) color scheme that comes with Vim? Go online and
pick new color schemes to customize your Vimmi


##Plugins

Vim also allows you to have plugins.

Here are some of my favorite ones: \\
1. pathogen
2. vim-airline
3. NERDtree
4. neocomplete


#Others

Happy vim-ing! :)
